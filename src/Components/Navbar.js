<p className='content-1'>While "healthy" is a term that gets thrown into conversations regularly, its flippant versatility can be confusing. If you search Instagram, you'll find insight into what society collectively considers the healthy ideal: fitness models behind filters, bodybuilders and their supplements, detoxing and fad diet claims, the virtues of “clean-eating,” and an extreme amount of juicing. You get the picture—you’ve probably seen the pictures, too. 
    <br/><br/>
    Researchers pinpoint some major problems with this near-constant imagery. First, media (particularly social media) plays a huge role in shaping what behaviors people consider important to reach a certain goal. But since these behaviors prioritize physical appearance, they’re generally linked with negative psychological effects and poorer physical health outcomes.
    <br/><br/>
    It comes down to this paradox: studies routinely show that someone's body shape is not a good indicator of how healthy they actually are.2 In a world where poor body image is fairly common, it's fair to question whether or not we may be missing the mark on what it means to be healthy.
